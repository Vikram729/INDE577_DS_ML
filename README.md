# INDE 577 Data Science and Machine Learning
## Machine Learning Algorithms

Welcome to the INDE 577 repository on machine learning algorithms! This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques implemented in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Structure
- **Supervised Learning**: This section contains examples of algorithms used in supervised learning. Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset to predict outcomes based on input features. It includes:
  - **Perceptron**: A simple linear classifier for binary classification.
  - **Gradient Descent**: An optimization technique used to minimize loss functions in various machine learning algorithms.
  - **Linear Regression**: A technique to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
  - **Logistic Regression**: A method for binary classification that predicts the probability of an outcome.
  - **Neural Networks**: Computational models inspired by the human brain that can perform complex pattern recognition tasks.
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple algorithm that classifies a data point based on its proximity to neighboring data points.
  - **Decision Trees**: A tree-like model that makes decisions based on feature values to classify data.
  - **Ensemble Methods**: Techniques like Random Forests that combine multiple models to improve prediction accuracy.

- **Unsupervised Learning**: This section contains examples of algorithms used in unsupervised learning, where the model learns patterns from unlabelled data. Unsupervised learning includes:
  - **K-Means Clustering**: A method that partitions data into K clusters based on similarity.
  - **DBSCAN**: A density-based clustering algorithm that can find clusters of arbitrary shapes.
