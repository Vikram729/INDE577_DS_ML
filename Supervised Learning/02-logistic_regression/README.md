Introduction
Logistic regression is a statistical method used to predict a binary outcome based on input features. In this example, we use logistic regression to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived based on various factors like age, gender, class, etc.

Dataset Information
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including:

Survival: Whether the passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
Fare: Ticket fare
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Code Components
The code for this logistic regression example includes:

Data Loading: Load the Titanic dataset from the Seaborn library.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize features.
Model Building: Use sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression to create a logistic regression model.
Model Training and Testing: Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model.
Performance Metrics: Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
Visualization: Create visualizations to understand the results and important features.
Running the Code
To run the code:

Model Performance
Accuracy: Represents the overall correctness of the model.
Precision: Measures how many positive identifications were correct.
Recall: Measures how many actual positives were identified correctly.
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Confusion Matrix
A confusion matrix shows the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates, providing a detailed view of the model's accuracy.

ROC Curve
The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrates the true positive rate against the false positive rate, providing insight into the model's ability to discriminate between classes.
