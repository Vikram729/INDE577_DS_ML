# Neural Networks

Neural networks are a class of machine learning models inspired by the human brain's structure and function. They consist of interconnected nodes or "neurons" that process information through weighted connections. Neural networks can learn complex patterns in data, making them suitable for various tasks such as classification, regression, and pattern recognition.

## Types of Neural Networks

Neural networks come in various architectures, each suited for specific tasks. Here are some of the common types:

### 1. Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)
In a feedforward neural network, information flows in one direction, from input to output, without cycles or loops. This type of network is often used for simple classification and regression tasks.

### 2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Convolutional neural networks are designed to process data with a grid-like topology, such as images. They use convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features, making them ideal for computer vision tasks.

### 3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
Recurrent neural networks have connections that loop back on themselves, allowing them to maintain a state over time. This feature makes RNNs suitable for sequence data like time series, text, or speech.

### 4. Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)
LSTMs are a type of RNN designed to address the "vanishing gradient" problem, allowing them to maintain long-term dependencies. They are commonly used in natural language processing and speech recognition.

### 5. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
Generative adversarial networks consist of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates synthetic data, while the discriminator tries to distinguish it from real data. GANs are popular for tasks like image generation and style transfer.

## How Neural Networks Work

A neural network is built from layers of neurons. Each neuron receives input, applies a weighted transformation, adds a bias, and passes the result through an activation function. The activation function introduces non-linearity, allowing the network to learn complex patterns.

The network's output is determined by the architecture and type of activation functions used. Neural networks are trained through a process called "backpropagation," where gradients of the loss function are used to update the weights and biases. This process is guided by an optimization algorithm like gradient descent.

## Example Neural Network

The example included in this repository demonstrates a simple neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras. It uses a feedforward neural network to classify the iris dataset, a well-known dataset containing measurements of iris flowers.

This example provides a basic introduction to building, compiling, and training a neural network. It also shows how to evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy.

To run the example, ensure you have TensorFlow installed, then follow the instructions in the corresponding notebook or script.
