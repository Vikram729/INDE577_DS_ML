# Linear Regression

## Overview
Linear regression is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal is to find the best-fitting straight line through a set of data points, minimizing the sum of squared residuals (differences between observed and predicted values).

## Theoretical Foundation
Linear regression is based on the assumption of linearity, meaning that the relationship between the dependent variable \(y\) and the independent variable \(x\) can be represented by a straight line. The general formula for a simple linear regression model is:

The method of least squares is typically used to estimate \(b_0\) and \(b_1\), with the goal of minimizing the sum of squared errors (SSE). This method uses derivatives to find the coefficients that minimize the total squared error.

## Applications
Linear regression is used in various fields, such as:

- **Economics**: Estimating relationships between economic indicators like income and spending.
- **Healthcare**: Predicting patient outcomes based on medical data.
- **Finance**: Modeling stock prices or financial trends.
- **Social Sciences**: Analyzing survey data to identify trends and relationships.
- **Engineering**: Determining correlations between different engineering parameters.

## Model Evaluation
Linear regression models are evaluated using metrics such as:

- **R-squared**: Represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model.
- **Adjusted R-squared**: Adjusted for the number of independent variables, providing a more accurate assessment for models with multiple predictors.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average of squared residuals.

## Challenges and Limitations
While linear regression is a powerful tool, it has several limitations:

- **Linearity Assumption**: The relationship must be linear; non-linear relationships require additional transformations or different models.
- **Outliers**: Sensitive to outliers, which can significantly skew results.
- **Multicollinearity**: If multiple predictors are highly correlated, it can affect the model's stability and coefficients.
- **Homoscedasticity**: Assumes constant variance in errors, which may not always be true.
