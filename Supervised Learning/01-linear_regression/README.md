# Linear Regression with Seaborn's Tips Dataset

This repository demonstrates how to build a simple linear regression model from scratch to predict the tip amount based on the total bill using Seaborn's "tips" dataset. It walks through the process of loading the dataset, pre-processing, splitting into training and test sets, defining custom linear regression functions, and evaluating the model using R-squared.

## Repository Structure

- `linear_regression_example.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the full code for building and testing a linear regression model with custom functions.
- `README.md`: This readme file, providing an overview of the project.

# How to Use This Code
Load the Dataset: The code uses Seaborn's "tips" dataset, which contains information about tips received by waitstaff in a restaurant, including details like total bill, tip amount, day, time, etc.

Select Features for Linear Regression: The example predicts the tip amount (tip) based on the total bill (total_bill).

Split the Data: The dataset is split into training and test sets using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.

Build Custom Linear Regression Functions: Functions for calculating slope, intercept, predictions, and R-squared are defined from scratch.

Build and Test the Linear Regression Model: The slope and intercept are calculated, predictions are made on the test set, and the model is evaluated with R-squared.

Plot the Linear Regression Line: A scatter plot with the regression line is created to visualize the relationship between the total bill and the tip.

# Results
The notebook outputs the following:

Slope and intercept for the linear regression model.
R-squared value, indicating how well the model fits the data.
A plot showing the linear regression line and scatter plot of data points.
