# Supervised Learning 

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. The dataset contains input-output pairs, with the output representing the target variable or "ground truth." The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping from the inputs to the target output, allowing the model to make predictions on unseen data. This ReadMe provides an overview of supervised learning, common algorithms, use cases, and additional resources for further exploration.

## Overview of Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, a machine learning model is given a set of inputs (features) along with corresponding outputs (labels or target variables). The model learns the relationship between the inputs and outputs by minimizing a loss function. Once trained, the model can make predictions on new, unseen data.

Supervised learning encompasses two primary tasks:
1. **Classification**: The task of predicting discrete categories or classes. For example, determining whether an email is spam or not.
2. **Regression**: The task of predicting continuous numerical values. For example, predicting a house price based on its features.

## Common Algorithms in Supervised Learning
Here are some widely used algorithms in supervised learning, with brief explanations and typical applications:

- **Linear Regression**: A simple algorithm for predicting continuous values. It models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- **Logistic Regression**: A linear classifier used for binary or multiclass classification. Despite its name, it is used for classification tasks.
- **Decision Trees**: A tree-based algorithm for both classification and regression. It creates a tree structure based on feature splits to make predictions.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A powerful classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes. It can also be used for regression tasks (SVR).
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric method that classifies instances based on the majority class among the k-nearest neighbors.
- **Gradient Boosting**: An ensemble technique that builds multiple models sequentially, each focusing on the errors of the previous model, leading to improved accuracy.
- **Neural Networks**: Complex models that use layers of interconnected neurons to learn complex patterns. These are widely used in deep learning applications.
